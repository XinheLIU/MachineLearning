## Data Collection

### Sampling methods

sampling methods

- random sampling
- stratified sampling

Sampling biases

- selection bias
- response bias
- [colliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(statistics))
  - [survival bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)
    - eg. hedge fund return

Estimators

estimator is a function, estimate is an realized value

    - consistent
    - unbiased
        - biased estimator may have smaller MSE (shrinkage)



- method of moments
- MLE
    - likelihood
* 		is the probability of a random sample taking value x under parameter θ. 
    - fisher information 
        - E(first deriv) = 0
        - Cram ́er-Rao Inequality for unbiased estimator
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound、


interval estimator
- confidence interval
- delta methods
