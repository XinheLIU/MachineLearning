Neural networks are the backbone of modern deep learning. These powerful models have revolutionized artificial intelligence and enabled breakthrough advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and many other fields.

## Basic Structure

A neural network consists of:
1. Input Layer
2. Hidden Layers
3. Output Layer

Each layer contains nodes (neurons) connected to nodes in adjacent layers.

## Key Components

### Neurons
Each neuron:
- Receives inputs
- Applies weights
- Adds a bias
- Applies an activation function

### Activation Functions
Common activation functions include:
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Sigmoid
- Tanh
- Softmax

## Training Process

Neural networks learn through:
1. Forward propagation
2. Loss calculation
3. Backpropagation
4. Weight updates

## Applications

Modern applications include:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Game playing

In future posts, we'll dive deeper into each of these components and explore how to implement neural networks using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
