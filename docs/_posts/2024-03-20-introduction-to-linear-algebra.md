Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations and linear functions. It is a fundamental area of mathematics with applications across many fields, particularly in machine learning and data science.

## Key Concepts

### Vectors
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. In linear algebra, we often work with vectors in n-dimensional space.

### Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used to:
- Solve systems of linear equations
- Represent linear transformations
- Store and manipulate data

### Linear Transformations
A linear transformation is a function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.

## Applications in Machine Learning

Linear algebra is essential in machine learning for:
1. Data representation
2. Dimensionality reduction
3. Feature extraction
4. Neural network operations

In future posts, we'll explore these concepts in more detail and see how they apply to machine learning algorithms.
