Linear regression is one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning. It serves as a starting point for understanding more complex algorithms and provides a simple yet powerful way to model relationships between variables.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## The Mathematics Behind It

The basic form of linear regression is:
\[ y = mx + b \]

Where:
- y is the dependent variable
- x is the independent variable
- m is the slope (coefficient)
- b is the y-intercept

## Key Concepts

1. **Assumptions**
   - Linear relationship
   - Independence of errors
   - Homoscedasticity
   - Normality of errors

2. **Model Evaluation**
   - R-squared
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Implementation

In future posts, we'll explore how to implement linear regression using Python and popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
